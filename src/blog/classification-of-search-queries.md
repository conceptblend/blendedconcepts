## Search process
Searching for things on the web has become so routine for most people that they probably don't even realize that they're following a regular process.

The search process goes like this:

1. Enter a query.
2. Get results back.
3. Scan for relevant results.
4. View a result or two.
5. Refine my query, if needed.

People repeat this process until some need is met or abandoned.

There are two important aspects of a search query: **intent** and **satisfaction**. The need or goal of a search query is expressed as intent and can be inferred based on the terms used and the structure of the query. Satisfaction comes when the goal, however small, is achieved.

## 3 types of search queries

| Search query type | Objective |
|-----|-----|
| Informational | Find data or information about a topic. |
| Navigational | Get to a specific, known website or URL. |
| Transactional | Take the first step in a series towards acquiring some resource. |

Categorizing searches into these goal-based groups gives us a glimpse into the intent behind a user's search. Analysis and classification of search phrases is useful when planning an information architecture, a content strategy, or an SEO strategy.

To get more clarity about user intent, we can compare search phrases with the sub-categories of each query type.

### Informational (I) sub-categories

- **Directed** (I,D) – I want specific information.
	- **Closed** (I,D,C) – I want the one, unambiguous answer to a specific question.
	- **Open** (I,D,O) – I want the answers to a specific question covering more than one topic.
- **Undirected** (I,U) – I want everything on this topic.
- **List** (I,L) – I want a list of things on this topic.
- **Find** (I,F) – I'm looking for a real world service or product that can be obtained.
- **Advice** (I,A) – I'm looking for advice or suggestions.


### Navigational (N) sub-categories

- **Navigational to Transactional** (N,T) – I want a URL that is transactional. (Doesn't seem very useful as a category.)
- **Navigational to Informational** (N,I) – I want a URL that is informational. (Also doesn't seem very useful as a category.)


### Transactional (T) sub-categories

- **Obtain** (T,O) – I want to obtain a specific resource or object.
	- **Online** (T,O,O) – I want a resource I will get online.
	- **Offline** (T,O,F) – I want a resource or object I will get offline.
- **Download** (T,D) – I want to find a specific file to download.
- **Results** (T,R) – I want a resource that can be found directly on the results page.
	- **Links** (T,R,L) – I want a resource that appears in the title, summary, or URL of a result.
	- **Other** (T,R,O) – I want a resource that appears somewhere other than in the the title, summary, or URL of a result.
- **Interact** (T,I) – I want to interact with a specifc resource or program.
