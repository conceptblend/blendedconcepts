# reflections on doing things that don't scale

### quotes

> Actually startups take off because the founders make them take off. There may be a handful that just grew by themselves, but usually it takes some sort of push to get them going. A good metaphor would be the cranks that car engines had before they got electric starters. Once the engine was going, it would keep going, but there was a separate and laborious process to get it going.

## Recruit

> The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually. Nearly all startups have to. You can't wait for users to come to you. You have to go out and get them.

Why manual recruiting? Why not marketing?
--> to get close to the customer, build a relationship, and learn?

* Stripe: "collision installation"
* Don't underestimate the power of **Compound growth**.: Grow your 10% customer base every week and see how it adds up.

> How do you find users to recruit manually? If you build something to solve your own problems, then you only have to find your peers, which is usually straightforward. Otherwise you'll have to make a more deliberate effort to locate the most promising vein of users. The usual way to do that is to get some initial set of users by doing a comparatively untargeted launch, and then to observe which kind seem most enthusiastic, and seek out more like them.

## Fragile

>Almost all startups are fragile initially. And that's one of the biggest things inexperienced founders and investors (and reporters and know-it-alls on forums) get wrong about them.

> The question to ask about an early stage startup is not "is this company taking over the world?" but "how big could this company get if the founders did the right things?" And the right things often seem both laborious and inconsequential at the time.

## Delight

> You should take extraordinary measures not just to acquire users, but also to make them happy.

> Your first users should feel that signing up with you was one of the best choices they ever made. And you in turn should be racking your brains to think of new ways to delight them.

> [A] reason founders don't focus enough on individual customers is that they worry it won't scale. But when founders of larval startups worry about this, I point out that in their current state they have nothing to lose. Maybe if they go out of their way to make existing users super happy, they'll one day have too many to do so much for. That would be a great problem to have. See if you can make it happen. And incidentally, when it does, you'll find that delighting customers scales better than you expected. Partly because you can usually find ways to make anything scale more than you would have predicted, and partly because delighting customers will by then have permeated your culture.

Delight can sometimes be a hard thing to achieve. But also not so hard. I've seen examples of where the expectation for the source of delight is in gimmicky moments in an app or in building unexpected "delighter" moments into an app the deliver surprise. They are charming, yes. They aren't really deeply delighting in a lasting way, though. This might be a hard one to get right. It has to exist in and around the core product. It's an ecosystem thing that really starts to build up a brand, and an image of a company, and a relationship (good or bad) between customer and product.
