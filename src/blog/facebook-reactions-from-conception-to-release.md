## The challenge

> We have spent a lot of time refining the Like, Comment, Share buttons so that it’s easy to use and understand. It is a surface that is interacted with a lot, so any change will affect the understandability and usability of millions of people’s actions. We needed to thoughtfully curate any change so it felt like a natural evolution, taking care not to feel abrupt or disrupt everyone on our platform.

## Highlight #1 &mdash; Principles

I really like that they had key principles for the two challenge tracks they were working on.

### Defining the Reactions

1. **Reactions should be universally understood**. Reactions should be understood globally, so more people can connect and communicate together.
2. **Reactions should be widely used and expressive**. Reactions should allow people to give feedback in more expressive ways that better align with the varied ways we react to things in real life.

### Designing the System of interaction and presentation

1. **Reactions should be an extension of the Like button**. Like, Comment, and Share are ubiquitous to Facebook, and adding a fourth option at this point would introduce more complexity.
2. **Reactions should not make existing behavior more difficult**. It was important that we introduced this feature responsibly, in a way that didn’t disrupt the way a billion people already used the product. In other words, we wanted to retain the simplicity and ease of Liking — when you tap on the Like button, you are "liking" the post.

## Highlight #2 &mdash; Sources of data

One year of research using an interesting set of sources:

- Top Stickers
- Most used search terms for Stickers
- Top short comments

These sources provided some excellent data that permitted the design team gain understanding of the intent and behaviour of millions of users world-wide. This is a really interesting way to research what people are trying to express on their platform.

## Highlight #3 &mdash; Prototypes

I love all of the prototyping and iteration of the interaction. Some look like they could have been acceptable but not award-winning. I would have loved to have been involved in that usability testing!!
